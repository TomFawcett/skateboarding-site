          This <a target='_blank' href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skateboarding">Wiki</a> page helped me find information about when skateboarding was invented. <br>
          <a target='_blank' href="https://csdt.org/culture/skateboarding/origins.html">CSDT</a> was a very helpful site and helped me find information about the history of skateboarding. <br>
          I also used some information <a target='_blank' href="https://www.redbull.com/us-en/history-of-skateboarding">RedBull</a> from to tell about the history of skateboarding.
