       The 50-50 is a type of grind, grinds are when you slide any part of your truck either a ledge or a rail. The 50-50 is when you pop on ollie (like I mentioned in the previous page) onto the ledge and half (most of the time more than half) of both of your trucks are the part grinding shown on the rail or ledge leaving your wheels hanging off (as shown on the left). This a good intermediate trick. However, you should learn multiple tricks before learning this, but the only necissary trick you must know is again, the ollie. <br> <br>

      <p class="tab">
       There are many other types of grinds such as, nosegrinds, 5-0 grinds, fable, and way too many more to go into. Something similar to grinds are slides, slides are when any part of your board slides on a ledge or rail, such as nose slides, tail slides, darkslides, and again, way too many more to go into. For an example of a slide, the image on the right shows a nose slide. It is pretty self explanitory but it is whe you ollie into a ledge or rail sliding your nose on it.
