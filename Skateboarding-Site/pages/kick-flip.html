        A Kickflip is one of the most known skateboarding tricks of all time. It is basically the motion of you popping your board while jumping, sliding your foot up the board to lift off the ground, and then kicking off the side to make the board flip under you and then landing back on it (as shown in the image on the left). This trick is not easy and it is recommended to know how to atleast know how to Ollie before attempting. The ollie is just the motion of popping your board and sliding up in order to lift the board off the ground (a kickflip without the actual flip). <br> <br>

        This was not the first version of a Kickflip. There is another trick which was the orginal Kickflip which is now called an "Old School Kickflip" which is where you push your front foot down and your back foot is under the board and lifts up causing the board to flip under you (as show on the image on the right). This version is a lot easier than the kickflip ow and most people could probably learn this trick without even learning an ollie first.
