      The tre flip (AKA a 360 flip) is an advanced trick that takes a lot of practice to be able to do. The three tricks you must know how to do before this trick are ollie, kickflip, and pop shuv it (although there a variety of tricks you should know or learn before attempting this trick). The motion of a Tre fip is first you must pop your board while scooping your foot backwards, also while jumping. The second step is after you have scooped hard you must slide your foot up and flick your foot as if you were to do a kick flip and lift your legs up to allow the board to do a 360 flip underneath you.
