      Skateboarding was orginally created in the 1950's in California. Surfers invented "sidewalk surfing" which was roller skate weels attached to boxes or wooden planks. This idea became popular quick with many companies starting to create them and make them better. By 1963 over 50 million skateboards were sold.

      There are many types of skateboards. Not all skateboards are bought fully built. For example, my entire skateboard was built from individual pieces. There are 5 major pieces to the skateboard (wheels, bearings, trucks, bushings, and deck). Most of those are self explanitory but the two that you might not know are the trucks and bushings. The trucks are the metals thing undermneath the board that holds the wheels, and the bushings are the things inside the truks that help keep your board straight and decide how loose you turn your board.

      Custom builds are mainly for skateboarders who do tricks because hey can easily replace any part and customized their board however they like. Pre-builds are more for people starting off skateboarding or who use it as trasportation. A better skateboard for transportation is called a longboard (they are smother and you can't do any tricks on them).
